Hello Everyone In this git I am appending all the data  I am getting to work on QT. 
I am using youtube videos and QT official documentation for learning QT. 
QT is used for making application and supports multiple coding languages such as c++, python, QML.

Youtube links which I used to learn QT are:
1) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIZiBcTr5urECberTITj7gjA">QT for Beginners</a>
2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2D1942A4688E9D63">C++ QT programming</a>

Documentation link   <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/reference-overview.html">  QT all classes</a>

From my experience it will be better if you know basics of HTML, XML, CSS
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/">XML</a>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/">CSS</a>

I will keep all my learning point in every folder and some points that I have learn in it.
QT can be used for making application for windows as well as mobile devices but I have used it for making application for embedded devices.

You can use other websites for downloading icon, background-images, svg and many more.

Folder sequence for learning:
1) UsingStackWidget
2) InsertStackWidget
3) Containers
4) FileSystem_Thread
5) MyFirstApp
